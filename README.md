# Source-Market
ecommerce website for source code using C# and ASP.NET

The aim of this project was to develop a full-stack eCommerce website using C# for the backend and ASP.NET for the frontend.
To create an engaging user experience, HTML, JS, and CSS were utilized to build the website's interface.
Additionally, the website is connected to a database, which was implemented using MS Access,
and several SQL commands were used to extract the relevant data for the users.

The project is divided into two primary folders for the frontend.
The first folder contains pages with a simple UI that do not require authorization, such as the homepage and catalog.
In contrast, the second folder, known as "USERAREA," contains pages that require authorization, such as the cart, my products, and profile pages.

The backend of the project consists of a folder containing several C# classes that perform various functions.
These classes have been rated based on their complexity, with some being relatively easy and others more challenging.
Additionally, there are universal functions that can adapt to the data they receive.

This project took one month to complete and was developed as a school project with a weight of 5 units.
Despite its classification as a difficult project, it received a perfect score of 100.
